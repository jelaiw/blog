## The problem
Why does the technology world have a cybersecurity problem? If you believe that "software is eating the world", then perhaps much of the answer lies in how we develop software.

To the extent that an existing vulnerability is a security bug that was _unwittingly_ written into code by a developer, how many bugs can we prevent from being introduced by improving secure coding competency and awareness?

After all, if the well-meaning developer knows to (and how to) write secure code, under what circumstances would vulnerable code still be produced?

## DevSecOps
Perhaps the desired outcome is possible with some thoughtful combination of people, tooling, and process? 

At least that is the hypothesis I get to test daily as an Application Security engineer working in DevOps, where I try to help teams by implementing self-service infrastructure (i.e., platform engineering) that puts alert data into developer hands at "the right time", ideally in phase with their standard workflow and when newly written code is still fresh in mind (_bugs are cheaper to fix then_).

However, this "layer of defense" primarily leverages SAST (static application security testing) at the pull request, which is great for what it is, as a timely safety net to catch known security bugs that we can detect through static analysis of code, but are there meaningful things we can do earlier in the SDLC -- _especially to avoid writing the bug in first place_?

## Secure coding
Can it be learned? Can it be taught? _What happens when we place more emphasis on teaching and learning_?

After inheriting a "videos + quizzes" secure coding training program a few years ago and eventually re-designing and re-implementing it around a platform (with a seemingly agreeable way to measure secure coding competency) that provides high-quality hands-on labs and a "hack it first, then fix it" approach for developers, I have reason to be cautiously optimistic, maybe even naively excited about further possibilities.

## The author
How did I get into security? Certainly not the direct route, if there is such a thing.

#### College years
I tried to become a medical doctor first. It took two years and completing all of the pre-med requirements before I figured out that I wouldn't be a good one. Happily, I changed my major to Computer Science.

At the time CS students were required to choose a concentration, mine was Computer Networking, which I loved. How could I tell? Well, for one thing, I enjoyed (and still do) reading IETF RFCs -- yes, really enjoy. We'd implement the network protocols of the time (like FTP) as part of labs, but some of us also implemented things like IRC clients (a kind of rite of passage) for fun.

Also, I got a part time job in the Computer Science department as a sysadmin, where I got to build and operate Windows NT servers, make CAT5 cables, and discover exactly what's under the floor tiles (server room had a raised floor). I had no doubt that I would be an operator after graduating.

#### First half
Accordingly, I spent the first decade of my career as a software developer. This was around the time of Y2K, the dot com boom, and when Java was James Gosling and Sun, not Oracle. Consequently, as an engineer who wrote mostly Java, I led a weekly OO design patterns study group, learned how to refactor (thanks to Martin Fowler), tried to program pragmatically (with much owed to Josh Bloch, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas), and generally had a good time.

The next decade was much tougher. Maybe a U-shaped happiness curve will be true for me. I ran a one-person LLC, which I'm glad I did, but it turned out to be a failed experiment. The rest of the time I spent doing data and DevOps engineering, which I was very good at, but if I'm being honest, mostly opened my eyes.

So I decided to pivot into cyber security, with a friendly shove from COVID. So far I seem to be finding a surprising kind of joy and satisfaction with work in this area -- is such a thing meant to last??

#### Early years
In hindsight, there were perhaps some telling hints that I would enjoy this leg of my journey.

As a Gen Xer, I grew up at a time where most households did not have a computer. Fun fact: I learned how to type on a typewriter in school. Then, in the middle of my childhood years, it seemed like everyone had a computer. Ours was an IBM PS/2.

Like many teenagers, I played a ton of games. My early PC favorites were adventure-based, like Space Quest, King's Quest, maybe even Leisure Suit Larry. Perhaps unlike most teenagers, I enjoyed spending time in a hex editor (some of my characters in Buck Rogers had unlikely and powerful items and unusually high character attributes) and defeating copy protection (whatever your personal feelings are about software piracy, defenders tend to benefit from understanding the personas, motivations, and economics of those you may be defending against).

Also, I distinctly remember the sheer delight of visiting Waldenbooks (now defunct) or the public library and heading straight for the "Computing" section to inhale the contents of every operating system book I could get my hands on. I was particularly obsessed with how passwords worked and how secrets were kept secret.

#### Friends
Lamentably, much of my early focus was MS-DOS because that's what ran on the home PC, but eventually I found my way to Linux, which reminds me to write a bit about those who have influenced and guided me, probably unbeknownst to them.

I will start with Jose R, a high school friend, whose love of phone phreaking and viruses (computer) helped light my own fire. I should say we spent most of our time goofing off.

Also, Chris G, a college classmate, who gave me my first Linux distro on CD. I forget if it was Slackware or RedHat. I do remember that I picked it up from him at his parent's house, where he stayed in the basement. It was night, he took the CD out of the burner, and to me it glowed like the first artifact in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

I will also mention Ben B, who was an actual real-life sysadmin at my first developer job, where I made my first big on-the-job mistake -- I'm fuzzy on the exact details now, but it involved `rm -rf` and an important server. He was cool about it, and like any good sysadmin, had a contingency for the stupid things developers sometimes do. I learned my lesson, and we became good friends.

If you like what you've read so far of my meandering and ongoing engineering travels, please let me know. As a student of history, I enjoy the recounting and even a playful reckoning. I'll try to write more.

Cheers!
