How did I get into security? Certainly not the direct route, if there is such a thing.

## College years
I tried to become a medical doctor first. It took two years and completing all of the pre-med requirements before I figured out that I wouldn't be a good one. Happily, I changed my major to Computer Science.

At the time CS students were required to choose a concentration, mine was Computer Networking, which turned out to be such a good fit. How could I tell? Well, for one thing, I enjoyed (and still do) reading IETF RFCs -- yes, really enjoy. We would implement the network protocols of the time (like the File Transfer Protocol, or FTP) as part of labs, but some of us also implemented things like IRC clients (a kind of rite of passage) on our own and for fun.

Also, I had a part time job in the Computer Science department as a sysadmin, where I got to build and operate Windows NT servers, make CAT5 cables, and discover exactly what's under the floor tiles (server room had a raised floor). I had no doubt that I would be a network admin or sysadmin after graduating. Whups!

## First half
Instead, I spent the first decade of my career as a software developer. This was around the time of Y2K, the dot com boom, and when Java was James Gosling and Sun, not Oracle. Object-oriented programming (OOP) and GUIs were the thing to learn, so I wrote mostly Java, led a weekly OOP design patterns study group, learned how to refactor (thanks to Martin Fowler), tried to program pragmatically (with much owed to Josh Bloch, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas), and generally had a good time.

The next decade was much tougher on me. I ran a one-person LLC, which I'm glad I did, but it turned out to be a failed experiment. The rest of the time I spent doing data and DevOps engineering, which started to open my eyes to how some of the problems plaguing cyber security could possibly be solved.

Now here I am, with a friendly shove forward from COVID. So far I seem to be finding a surprising kind of joy and satisfaction -- is such a thing meant to last??

## Early years
In hindsight, there were perhaps some telling hints that I would enjoy this leg of my journey.

As a Gen Xer, I grew up at a time when most households did not have a computer. Fun fact: I learned how to type on a typewriter in school. Then, in the middle of my childhood years, it seemed like everyone had a computer. Ours was an IBM PS/2.

Like many teenagers, I played a ton of games. My early PC favorites were adventure-based, like Space Quest, King's Quest, maybe even Leisure Suit Larry. Perhaps unlike most teenagers, I enjoyed spending time in a hex editor (some of my characters in Buck Rogers had unlikely and powerful items and unusually high character attributes) and defeating copy protection (whatever your personal feelings are about software piracy, defenders tend to benefit from understanding the personas, motivations, and economics of those you may be defending against).

Also, I distinctly remember the sheer delight of visiting Waldenbooks (now defunct) or the public library and heading straight for the "Computing" section to inhale the contents of every operating system book I could get my hands on. I was particularly obsessed with how passwords worked and how secrets were kept secret.

## Friends
Lamentably, much of my early focus was MS-DOS because that's what ran on the home PC, but eventually I found my way to Linux, which reminds me to write a bit about those who have influenced and guided me, probably unbeknownst to them.

I will start with Jose R, a high school friend, whose love of phone phreaking and viruses (computer) helped spark and nurture my own fire for "learning by hacking". I should say we spent most of our time goofing off.

Also, Chris G, a college classmate, who gave me my first Linux distro on CD. I forget if it was Slackware or RedHat. I do remember that I picked it up from him at his parent's house, where he stayed in the basement. It was night, he took the CD out of the burner, and to me it glowed like the gold idol artifact in Raiders of the Lost Ark.

I will also mention Ben B, who was an actual real-life sysadmin at my first developer job, where I made my first big on-the-job mistake -- I'm fuzzy on the exact details now, but it involved `rm -rf` and an important server. He was cool about it, and like any good sysadmin, had a contingency for the stupid things developers sometimes do. I learned my lesson, and we became good friends.

## The blog
If you like what you've read so far of my meandering (and ongoing) engineering travels, please let me know and I'll try to write more. As a student of history, I enjoy the recounting and even a playful reckoning.

Cheers!
