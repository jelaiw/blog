## The Problem
Why does the technology world have a cybersecurity problem? If you believe that "software is eating the world", then perhaps much of the answer lies in how we develop software.

To the extent that an existing vulnerability is a security bug that was unwittingly written into code by a developer, can we prevent new bugs from being introduced while writing software? 

After all, if the well-meaning, but busy developer knows how to write secure code, would they still otherwise choose to write vulnerable code?

## DevSecOps is not Everything
Perhaps this is possible with some thoughtful combination of training, tooling, and process? 

At least that is the hypothesis I put to test daily as an Application Security engineer, where I try to help teams by implementing self-service infrastructure that (ideally) provides developers with alert data at the "right time", both in phase with their standard workflow and when newly written code is still freshly in mind (_bugs are cheaper to fix then_).

However, what I describe primarily leverages SAST (static application security testing) at the pull request, which is great for what it is, as a timely safety net to catch known security bugs that we can detect through static analysis of code, but are there meaningful things we can do earlier in the SDLC -- _especially to avoid writing the bug in first place_?

## Secure coding is not a side quest
Can secure coding be learned? Can it be taught?

After taking over an existing "videos + quizzes" secure coding training program a few years ago and eventually re-designing and re-implementing it around a platform that provides high-quality hands-on labs and a "hack it first, then fix it" approach, I have reason to be cautiously optimistic, maybe even naively excited about the possibilities.

This blog tries to playfully explore these questions, in part through a recounting (and reckoning) of my own meandering engineering travels, including books/papers/posts I've read (both good and bad), boxes/rooms/labs I've tried to hack while learning how to AppSec myself, and the values and history that I hope are not forgotten or de-valued along the way as we try to solve this problem.
