How did I get into security? Certainly not the direct route, if there is such a thing.

## College years
I tried to become a medical doctor first. It took two years before I figured out that I wouldn't be a good one. By then, all of my pre-med requirements were completed, but a sunk cost is a sunk cost. A bit more thoughtfully, I changed my major to Computer Science.

At the time CS students were required to choose a concentration, mine was Computer Networking, which turned out to be such a good fit. How could I tell? Well, for one thing, I enjoyed (and still do) reading IETF RFCs -- _yes, really enjoy_. We would implement the network protocols of the time (e.g., File Transfer Protocol, or FTP) as part of hands-on labs, but some of us also implemented things like IRC clients (a kind of rite of passage) on our own and for fun.

Also, I had a part time job in the Computer Science department as a sysadmin, where I got to build and operate Windows NT servers, make CAT5 cables, and discover exactly what's under the floor tiles (server room had a raised floor). I had no doubt that I would be a network admin or sysadmin after graduating. Whups!

## U-shaped curve?
Instead, I spent the first decade of my career as a software developer. This was around the time of Y2K, the dot com boom, and when Java was James Gosling and Sun, not Oracle. Object-oriented programming (OOP) and GUIs were the thing to learn, so I wrote mostly Java, led a weekly OOP design patterns study group, learned how to refactor (thanks to Martin Fowler), tried to program pragmatically (with much owed to Josh Bloch, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas), and generally had a good time.

The next decade was much tougher on me. I ran a one-person LLC, which I'm glad I did, but it turned out to be a failed experiment. I also did data and DevOps engineering, which started to open my eyes to how some of the problems plaguing cyber security could possibly be solved.

Now here I am, _with a friendly shove forward from COVID_. So far I seem to be finding a surprising kind of joy and satisfaction -- is such a thing meant to last??

## Growing up
Looking back on my childhood now, there were some telling hints that I might one day enjoy the hard work of security.

As a Gen Xer, I grew up at a time when most households did not have a computer. Then, somewhere in the middle, it seemed like everyone had a personal computer (PC). Ours was an IBM PS/2.

Like many teenagers, I played a ton of games. My early PC favorites were adventure-based, like Space Quest, King's Quest, maybe even Leisure Suit Larry. Unlike most, I enjoyed defeating copy protection and spending time in a hex editor (some of my characters in a Buck Rogers RPG had unlikely and powerful items and unusually high character attributes).

Also, I distinctly remember the sheer delight of visiting Waldenbooks (now defunct) or the public library and heading straight for the "Computing" section to inhale the contents of every operating system book I could get my hands on. I was particularly obsessed with how passwords worked and how secrets were kept secret.
