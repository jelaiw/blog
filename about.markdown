How did I get into security? Certainly not the direct route, if there is such a thing.

## College
I tried to become a medical doctor first. It took two years before I figured out that I wouldn't be a good one. By then, all of my pre-med requirements were completed, but a sunk cost is a sunk cost. A bit more thoughtfully, I changed my major to Computer Science.

At the time CS students were required to choose a concentration, mine was Computer Networking. I discovered that I enjoyed (and still do) reading IETF RFCs -- _yes, really enjoy_. Naturally, I implemented all the network protocols of the time, including an IRC client (a kind of rite of passage). Then the internet became important, so it seems to have worked out.

I also had a part time job in the Computer Science department, where I got to build Windows NT servers, make CAT5 cables, and discover exactly what's under the raised floor panels in the server room. I had no doubt that I would be a network admin or sysadmin after graduating. Whups!

## Work
Instead, I spent the first decade of my career as a software developer. This was around the time of Y2K, the dot com boom, and when Java was James Gosling and Sun Microsystems. 

Object-oriented programming (OOP) and GUIs were the thing to learn, so I wrote mostly Java, led a weekly OOP design patterns study group, learned how to refactor (thanks to Martin Fowler), tried to program pragmatically (with much owed to Josh Bloch, Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas), and generally had a good time.

The next decade was much tougher on me. 

I ran a one-person LLC, which I'm glad I did because it taught me about sales, product, and the power of the MVP (minimum viable product), but it ultimately turned out to be a sort of failed experiment. Data and DevOps came next, and my eyes opened to how some problems in security could be solved with platform engineering.

 _After a friendly shove forward from COVID_, I now get to work on AppSec problems full-time. Not quite sure how I pulled that off.

## Growing up
Looking back on my childhood now, I suppose there were some clues and foreshadowing. As a Gen Xer, I grew up at a time when most households did not own a personal computer (PC). Then, somewhere in the middle, it seemed like everyone had one. Ours was an [IBM PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2).

Like many teenagers, I played a ton of games. My early PC favorites were adventure-based, like [Space Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest), King's Quest, maybe even Leisure Suit Larry. Unlike most, I enjoyed defeating copy protection and spending time in a hex editor (correspondingly my characters in the [Buck Rogers RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers:_Matrix_Cubed) sometimes had conspicuously powerful items and unusually high character attributes).

I distinctly remember the sheer delight of visiting Waldenbooks (now defunct) or the public library and heading straight for those treasured shelves to inhale the contents of every operating system book I could get my hands on. I was particularly obsessed with how passwords worked and how secrets were kept secret.

Twenty years flew by before I really tried again to grok cryptography, but what a joy it is now.
