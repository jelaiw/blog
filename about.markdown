## The problem
Why does the technology world have a cybersecurity problem? If you believe that "software is eating the world", then perhaps much of the answer lies in how we develop software.

To the extent that an existing vulnerability is a security bug that was unwittingly written into code by a developer, can we prevent new bugs from being introduced while writing software? 

After all, if the well-meaning, but busy developer knows how to write secure code, would they still otherwise choose to write vulnerable code?

## Maybe DevSecOps is not everything
Perhaps the desired outcome is possible with some thoughtful combination of people, tooling, and process? 

At least that is the hypothesis I put to test daily as an Application Security engineer, where I try to help teams by implementing self-service infrastructure that (ideally) provides developers with alert data at the "right time", both in phase with their standard workflow and when newly written code is still fresh in mind (_bugs are cheaper to fix then_).

However, what I just described primarily leverages SAST (static application security testing) at the pull request, which is great for what it is, as a timely safety net to catch known security bugs that we can detect through static analysis of code, but are there meaningful things we can do earlier in the SDLC -- _especially to avoid writing the bug in first place_?

## Secure coding is not a side quest
Can it be learned? Can it be taught? _What happens when we place our emphasis on teaching and learning_?

After taking over an existing "videos + quizzes" secure coding training program a few years ago and eventually re-designing and re-implementing it around a platform that provides high-quality hands-on labs and a "hack it first, then fix it" approach for developers, I have reason to be cautiously optimistic, maybe even naively excited about the possibilities.

Time will tell.

## The blog itself
I try to explore these questions, mostly playfully, by a recounting (and maybe reckoning) of my own meandering engineering travels, including books/papers/posts I've read, boxes/rooms/labs I've tried while "riding the struggle bus", and more.

Happy reading!
