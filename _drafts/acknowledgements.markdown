## Friends along the way
Lamentably, much of my early focus was MS-DOS because that's what ran on the PS/2, but eventually I found my way to Linux, which reminds me to acknowledge some of those who have influenced and guided me, probably unbeknownst to them.

I will start with Jose R, a high school friend, whose love and study of phone phreaking and computer viruses helped spark and nurture my own fire for "learning by hacking". I should say we spent most of our time goofing off.

Also, Chris G, a college classmate, who gave me my first Linux distro on CD. I forget if it was Slackware or RedHat. I do remember that I picked it up from him at his parent's house, where he stayed in the basement. It was night, he took the CD out of the burner, and to me it glowed like the gold idol artifact from Raiders of the Lost Ark.

I will also mention Ben B, who was an actual real-life sysadmin at my first developer job, where I made my first big on-the-job mistake -- I'm fuzzy on the exact details now, but it involved `rm -rf` and an important server. He was cool about it, and like any good sysadmin, had a contingency for the stupid things developers sometimes do. I learned my lesson, and we became good friends.
