How did I get into security? Certainly not the direct route, if there is such a thing.

## College
I tried to become a medical doctor first. It took two years before I figured out that I wouldn't be a good one. By then, all of my pre-med requirements were completed, but a sunk cost is a sunk cost. A bit more thoughtfully, I changed my major to Computer Science.

At the time CS students were required to choose a concentration, mine was Computer Networking. I discovered that I enjoyed reading IETF RFCs [^1] -- _yes, really enjoy_, so naturally, I implemented my own Internet Relay Chat client [^2] and hung out on [EFnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet). Then the internet became important, so it seems to have worked out.

I also had a part time job in the Computer Science department, where I got to build Windows NT servers, make CAT5 cables, and tinker with networks. I had no doubt that I would be a network admin or sysadmin after graduating. Whups!

## Work
Instead, I spent the first decade of my career as a software developer. This was around the time of Y2K, the dot com boom, and when Java was James Gosling and Sun Microsystems. Object-oriented programming (OOP) was the thing to learn, so I wrote mostly Java, learned how to refactor [^3], and tried to program pragmatically [^4].

The next decade was much tougher on me. 

I ran a one-person LLC, which taught me about sales, business administration, and the power of the [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), but it ultimately turned out to be a sort of failed experiment. Data and DevOps came next, and my eyes opened to how some problems in security could be solved with platform engineering.

 _After a friendly shove forward from COVID_, I now get to work on AppSec problems full-time. Not quite sure how I pulled that off.

## Growing up
Looking back on my childhood now, I suppose there were some clues and foreshadowing. As a Gen Xer, I grew up at a time when most households did not own a personal computer (PC). Then, somewhere in the middle, it seemed like everyone had one. Ours was an [IBM PS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PS/2).

Like many teenagers, I played a ton of games. My early PC favorites were adventure-based, like [Space Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_I), [King's Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I), [Police Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Quest:_In_Pursuit_of_the_Death_Angel), and pretty much anything else from Sierra On-Line. 

Unlike most, I enjoyed defeating copy protection and spending time in a hex editor. Correspondingly, my characters in the [Buck Rogers RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers:_Matrix_Cubed) sometimes had conspicuously powerful items and unusually high character attributes.

I distinctly remember the sheer delight of visiting Waldenbooks (now defunct) or the public library and heading straight for those treasured shelves to inhale the contents of every operating system book I could get my hands on. I was particularly obsessed with how passwords worked and how secrets were kept secret.

Twenty years flew by before I really tried again to grok cryptography.
