How did I get into security? Certainly not the direct route, if there is such a thing.

## Getting a college degree
I tried to become a medical doctor first. It took two years before I figured out that I wouldn't be a good one. By then, all of my pre-med requirements were completed, but a sunk cost is a sunk cost. A bit more thoughtfully, I changed my major to Computer Science.

At the time CS students were required to choose a concentration, so I chose Computer Networking, where I discovered that I enjoyed reading IETF RFCs [^1]. _Yes, really enjoyed_, so naturally I implemented my own Internet Relay Chat client [^2], moderated `#linux` and `#java` on EFnet [^3], and chatted with the various colorful and shadowy characters that hung out there at the edge of a new and wild digital frontier. Then the internet became important, so it seems to have worked out.

When I wasn't studying or goofing off, I also worked part-time for a gruff, no-nonsense system administrator named Bruce Williams, who ran IT for the Computer Science department. I got to build Windows NT servers, make CAT5 cables, and tinker with networks, which was far more fun than it should have been for a student job. I had no doubt that I would be a network admin or sysadmin after graduating. Whups!

## Going pro
Instead, I spent the first decade of my career as a software developer, starting with the roller coaster ride that was Y2K and the dot com boom. The Agile manifesto was drafted, Java was James Gosling and Sun Microsystems (now defunct), and object-oriented programming (OOP) was the thing to learn, so I wrote mostly Java, learned how to refactor [^4], and tried to program pragmatically [^5]. Along the way, I even became an early adopter of continuous integration -- Hudson, lava lamps, and all.

In retrospect, I learned to care about design, to respect the careful craftsmanship that went into good software engineering, and to wonder about secure coding, all of which planted important seeds that I would not try to sow until much later.

In the 2010s, I went on a side quest and started a one-person LLC, which taught me about sales, business administration, and the power of the [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product), but it ultimately turned out to be a sort of failed experiment.

Data and DevOps came next, and my eyes opened to how some problems in security could be solved with platform engineering. _After a friendly shove forward from COVID_, I now get to work on security engineering full-time. Not quite sure how I pulled that off.

## Growing up
Looking back on my childhood now, I suppose there were some clues and foreshadowing. As a Gen Xer, I grew up at a time when most households did not own a personal computer (PC). Then, somewhere in the middle, it seemed like everyone had one [^6].

Like many teenagers, I played video games. My early PC favorites were adventure-based, like [Space Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Quest_I), [King's Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Quest_I), [Police Quest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Quest:_In_Pursuit_of_the_Death_Angel), and pretty much anything else from Sierra On-Line. 

Unlike most, I enjoyed defeating copy protection and spending time in a hex editor. Correspondingly, my team in the [Buck Rogers RPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Rogers:_Matrix_Cubed) sometimes had conspicuously powerful items and unusually high character attributes.

I distinctly remember the sheer delight of visiting Waldenbooks (also now defunct) or the public library and heading straight for those treasured shelves to inhale the contents of every operating system book I could get my hands on. I was particularly obsessed with how passwords worked and how secrets were kept secret.

## Footnotes
[^1]: These [requests for comment](https://www.ietf.org/process/rfcs/) by the Internet Engineering Task Force can be dense.
[^2]: Implementing IRC was a kind of nerdy rite of passage at that time. I have fond memories of diving into [the RFC for this protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1459).
[^3]: Probably too much jargon for the casual reader. Channel operators had the power to set topics, kick out unruly members, and otherwise moderate a channel. Channels on [EFnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFnet) where I had ops included `#linux` and `#java`, two topics of my interest during those days.
