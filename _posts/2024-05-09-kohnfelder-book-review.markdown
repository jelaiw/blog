## The Good
Mr. Kohnfelder writes clearly and enjoyably about a very technical topic, not an easy feat. I also appreciate how privacy is intentionally discussed and revisited throughout.

The "Patterns" chapter and both chapters in "Part II: Designs" stand out for me. Also Appendix A, which has a sample design document we are invited to work through. _How often does an author figure out a way to give motivated readers an opportunity to practice fleshing out a design and then SDR it_? 

Bravo!

## The Bad
Shame that this book is not more popular given how well-written it is.

Indeed, it came to me as part of a Humble Bundle, which I purchased primarily to read other books. I happened to peek at the foreword (written by Adam Shostack, and offering a compelling endorsement of its contents) and preface and got serendipitously snagged into reading the whole thing.

Definitely underrated right now, though I expect this will change over time.

## Parting Thoughts
A fun tidit I learned was that Mr. Kohnfelder co-developed the STRIDE threat taxonomy. _Yes, that STRIDE_.

The original paper, published internally at Microsoft in 1999, is [publicly available now][stride-paper], which is a gift for those of us who appreciate history and study its artifacts.

_This is a book I can heartily recommend_, especially to those who are new to application security and could benefit from a solid foundation from which to learn about secure coding.
