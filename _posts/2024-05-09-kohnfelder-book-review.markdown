This is a book I can heartily recommend, especially to those that are new to application security and could benefit from a solid foundation from which to learn about secure coding.

Mr. Kohnfelder writes clearly and enjoyably about a very technical topic, not an easy feat. I also appreciate how guidance on privacy concerns is woven throughout.

I liked the whole book, but the "Patterns" chapter and both chapters in "Part II: Designs" stand out for me. Also Appendix A, which has a sample design document we are invited to work through. _How often does an author figure out a way to give motivated readers an opportunity to practice fleshing out a design and then SDR it_? Awesome!
