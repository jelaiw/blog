_This is a book I can heartily recommend_, especially to those who are new to application security and could benefit from a solid foundation from which to learn about secure coding.

## The Good
Mr. Kohnfelder writes clearly and enjoyably about a very technical topic, not an easy feat. I also appreciate how guidance on privacy concerns is woven throughout.

The "Patterns" chapter and both chapters in "Part II: Designs" stand out for me. Also Appendix A, which has a sample design document we are invited to work through. _How often does an author figure out a way to give motivated readers an opportunity to practice fleshing out a design and then SDR it_? 

Bravo!

## The Bad
Shame that this book is not more popular given how well-written it is.

Indeed, it came to me as part of a Humble Bundle, where I happened to peek at the foreword (written by Adam Shostack, and offering a compelling endorsement of its contents) and preface and got serendipitously snagged into reading the whole thing.
