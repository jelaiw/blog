This is a book I can heartily recommend to developers I'm coaching, especially those that are new to application security and could benefit from a solid foundation from which to learn about secure coding.

Mr. Kohnfelder writes clearly and enjoyably about a very technical topic, not an easy feat. I also appreciate how guidance on privacy concerns is woven throughout, which I don't often see and for which I am grateful.

I liked the whole book, and personally get the most re-play/re-use out of the "Patterns" chapter and both chapters in "Part II: Designs" (also Appendix A, which has a sample design document we are invited to work through). _How often does an author figure out a way to give a motivated reader an opportunity to practice fleshing out a design and then review it_? Awesome!
